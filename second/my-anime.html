<!-- <h2 style="color:#fe0000;">Otaku? What's that..?</h2>
<hr>
<div class="meabout">
<p>First of all, what is an <b style="color:#fe0000;">otaku</b> you may be asking? An otaku is a person who is interested in the Japanese culture, as well as a person who <i style="color:#fe0000;">watches anime, reads manga, and perhaps even cosplay.</i>
   Otaku is extremely different compared to <b style="color:#fe0000;">weeaboo</b>, people often get these two words confused together, but an otaku is interested in another's culture as well as keeping in touch with their own culture. A weeaboo is one
   who is interested in the others culture to an extreme that they lose touch within their own culture, and eventually is accused of wanting to become a different ethnicity (Japanese). Despite all of this, it is not the case for all otakus and weeaboos alike!</p> -->
  <!-- <hr>
    <p>
      So, talking about the otaku thing again..<br>
    The life of an otaku is a very simplistic and adequate lifestyle.
    An otaku usually watches anime a lot in their spare time, or at anytime given! Otakus seem to be very dedicated to anime and manga, I definitely admire how
      some can watch multiple animes in one day and how some can finish mangas easily. Otakus always usually catch up on the latest and hot animes, and news about animes! Whether it be if their favourite anime is getting a reboot or another season, they always find out.
    Manga and anime are maybe the best known <i style="color:#fe0000;">Japanese cultural export products</i>, and with their globalization, otaku also became a global phenomenon.</p> -->

After awakening from decades of slumber, Beerus tells <b style="color:#fe0000;">Whis</b>, his attendant, that he is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the <b style="color:#fe0000;">Super Saiyan God</b>.
               To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus by using the power of five Super Saiyans, which includes <i style="color:#fe0000;">Vegeta, Gohan, Son Goten, Trunks,</i> and the baby in <b style="color:#fe0000;">Videl's</b> womb.
               Despite losing, Goku's efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides to spare the planet.
               While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and Whis to train for a year, the remaining remnants of Frieza's army arrive on Earth in search for the Dragon Balls to revive <b style="color:#fe0000;">Frieza</b>. Frieza gets revived and achieves a new form
               <b style="color:#fe0000;">Golden Frieza</b> who comes to earth to take revenge from Goku but gets defeated by Goku and Vegeta with the help of reversing time technique that Whis posses.

Goku forfeits the match to make Hit fight with his full strength.
               The heavy form makes a toll of Goku's body. Hit gets inspired from Goku to work even more harder.
                Later, <b style="color:#fe0000;">Future Trunks</b> reappears and brings news of a new and powerful enemy resembling Goku, who is known as <b style="color:#fe0000;">Goku Black</b>.

                He planed to wipe out all mortals but was defeated by Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks in an epic battle.
                After that, the Grand Zeno holds a new tournament called <i style="color:#fe0000;">Tournament of Power</i> and includes all 10 universes in it. The losing ones will be erased.
                <i>Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Android 17, Android 18, Piccolo, Tien, Master Roshi, and a temporarily revived Frieza</i> join the tournament as representatives for the 7th Universe to protect it.

                  The tournament ends with Goku and Frieza taking <b style="color:#fe0000;">Jiren</b> down along with themselves, which leaves <b style="color:#fe0000;">Android 17</b> the sole contestant remaining and the winner of the Tournament of Power. They wish all erased universes
